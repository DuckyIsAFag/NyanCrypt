If you would like to contribute to NyanCrypt please upload new .pyw files to the "Community contributions" branch. Once you have uploaded a new file, a moderator or content creator will review your files to see if they applicable to the NyanCrypt project. We also have a couple of guidelines which you may need to read before uploading your own .pyw contribution. The guidelines can be found in the "Community contributions/guidelines" file.
