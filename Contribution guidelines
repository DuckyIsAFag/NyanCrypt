Thank you for deciding to contribute to "NyanCrypt v1.0". Before you upload your contribution, please make sure your Python file follows these steps.

Annotation:
  #Code must be annotated to an agreeable standard along with a declaration that the code is yours.
  #Please ensure that your code is clear and read-able.

Avoiding duplicate posts:
  #Before posting, please make sure that no there's no other similar contribution. (E.g You contribute a different gui system when another has already been contributed which is similar to yours).
  
Avoiding "patch-it-up" fixes:
  #Before posting, please make sure that your code is fully functional and not buggy. Please also make sure that your code isn't a "patch-it-up" fix to a bug or issue, as these methods can lead to more serious issues in the future.
  #Also remember that if your code poses security risks to the cryptographic algorithms put in place. It will be removed.
  
Contributions to the random number generation system:
  #Before posting a random number generator, please detail the name of the algorithm in use, you must also test the PRNG using the chi-square testing methodology. In your chi-square report, please detail the degrees of freedom (number of buckets -1) and then your statistical calculation based on the result.
  
Using python modules:
  #In NyanCrypt we are trying to reduce the amount of "non-standard modules" in use. Currently we are using:::
  
    #MATHEMATIC MODULES
    +math
    +fractions
    +random
    #Data handling
    +pickle
    +sys
    #System
    +os
    
    #GUI
    +tkinter (as tk)
    +tkinter.filedialog (as filedialog)
    +tkinter.messagebox (as message_box)
    + FROM tkinter + PhotoImage
    
    #Image manipulation (non standard { pip install PIL } / {python -m pip install PIL})
    ++FROM PIL + Image (as PIL_IMAGE)
    ++FROM PIL + ImageTk (as TK_IMAGE)
